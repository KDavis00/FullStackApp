🧠 What I've Worked On With Copilot
1. Diagnosed a Blazor Routing Error
You encountered:

“Sorry, there's nothing at this address.” “An unhandled error has occurred.”

We traced this to a missing or broken route component — likely Home.razor or NavMenu.razor.

2. Troubleshot Layout and Routing
We walked through:

✅ Verifying App.razor routing setup

✅ Inspecting MainLayout.razor and isolating <NavMenu /> as a possible issue

✅ Testing with a simplified layout to confirm the source of the crash

3. Identified an Incomplete Homepage
You mentioned your Home.razor isn’t finished — which could explain why the root route ("/") isn’t rendering properly.
